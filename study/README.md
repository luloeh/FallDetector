This folder contains the recordings obtained in the study as described in chapter 6 of my Bachelor's thesis.
The folders are sorted by subject, each contains all actions the person performed.

act3: walk a few steps to a pen on the floor and pick it up

act5: 'fall' backwards into a soft chair from standing position
act6: sweep the floor with a broom for some time
